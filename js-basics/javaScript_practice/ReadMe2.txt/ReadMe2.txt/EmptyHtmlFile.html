        <h1>My name is Amanda</h1>
        <p>I collect exotic Tarantula's</p>
        <div>

        </div>
        <p>I have <em>Seventeen</em> total</p>

      <h2><strong>They come in all kinds of colors</strong></h2>

      <p>Just to name a few</p>
        <ul>
       Versa color,
       Pink Toe,
       Mexican Red Knee,
       Mexican Pink(2),
       T. Albo (2),
       Pumpkin Patch
        </ul>

        <p>Every time I think I have them all, I find more to buy.</p>
        <p>They are very intresting to watch.</p>
         
        <p>You can buy 2 of thesame species,
        and they'll behave very diffrently from one another</p>

        <h2>Eating Machine's</h2>

        <p>Most tarantula's love food,
        I feed them cricket's and mealworms</p>

        <p>They <em>Really</em> enjoy it when I give the crickets
        apple before feeding them</p>
